## Book2Quiz
> **Summary**
>
> - No account is required.  
> - By default, the app does not transmit personal data to any server.  
> - Optional telemetry is disabled by default and can be enabled or disabled at any time in Settings.  
> - Local diagnostic logs may be stored on your device and can be cleared from App Diagnostics.

## Data We Process

**Content usage.** Your reading progress and quiz results are stored locally on your device to provide features like resume and results. This information is not transmitted by the app.

**Diagnostics (optional).** If you enable telemetry in Settings, the app can write local diagnostic entries (for example, page views, events, and exceptions) to a rolling log file in the app cache. These entries are intended to help you or support troubleshoot issues. The app does not upload these logs.

## Data Sharing

The app does not share your personal data with third parties. If you choose to use the platform share sheet (for example, to share diagnostics or a report), you control the destination and content being shared.

## Data Security

Local data is stored in the app sandbox provided by your operating system. You can clear diagnostic logs from App Diagnostics and reset quiz progress from Quiz Settings. Do not include sensitive information in support or feedback text you enter in the app.

## Retention

Local quiz progress and settings remain on your device until you uninstall the app or reset them. Diagnostic logs are pruned automatically to manage size and can be cleared by you at any time.

## Your Choices

- **Telemetry:** Toggle on or off in Settings.  
- **Clear logs:** Use App Diagnostics to clear the local log.  
- **Reset progress:** Use Quiz Settings to reset all quiz data.

## Children

This app is a study tool and does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Supervision is recommended for younger users.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in the app. Material changes will be noted in the app update notes and in this page.
